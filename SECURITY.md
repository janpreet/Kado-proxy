## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of kado-proxy seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, I appreciate your help in disclosing it to me in a responsible manner.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

2. Email me directly at kado@janpreet.com. If possible, please encrypt your message using my Keybase public key, can be found at https://keybase.io/janpreet.

3. Include as much information as possible in your report:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any possible mitigations you've identified

4. Allow me some time to review and respond to your report. As a solo developer, I'll do my best to address the issue as quickly as possible, but please understand that it might take some time.

## What to Expect

When you submit a vulnerability report, you can expect the following from me:

1. I will confirm receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days.

2. I will provide an initial assessment of the report within 10 business days.

3. I will keep you informed about the progress of fixing and publicly disclosing the vulnerability.

4. I will credit you for discovering and reporting the vulnerability (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Disclosure Policy

When I receive a security bug report, I will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit the code to find any potential similar problems.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## My Pledge

As the sole developer and maintainer of this project, I pledge to make participation in my project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

I pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

As the project maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to me, the project maintainer, at kado@janpreet.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

As the sole maintainer, I am responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. Enforcement may include:

1. Editing or deleting inappropriate comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions.
2. Blocking the offending user from interacting with the repository.
3. Closing and locking issues or pull requests.
4. In severe or repeated cases, reporting the user to GitHub for further action.

I respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident and will not disclose their identity without their explicit permission.

## Enforcement Guidelines

I will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action I deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction
   * Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
   * Consequence: A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

2. Warning
   * Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
   * Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. This may include deleting offending comments or blocking the user's ability to comment for a specified period of time.

3. Temporary Ban
   * Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   * Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community. This includes blocking the user from the repository for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with me as the enforcer of the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.

4. Permanent Ban
   * Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
   * Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community. This includes permanent blocking from the repository and, in severe cases, reporting the user to GitHub.
